#Simulation: The Tortoise and the Hare (See page 152)

#Instead of 2 functions to generate the percentages in the table for the tortoise and the hare, 
# use a single move() function and distinguish between hare/tortoise using a parameter.  

#Create a second function print_positions() to display the dist-position line (see below). 
# The function should include an optional argument border which defaults to False.
# When the function is called with True, the output should be bracketed between [ and ]. 
# Be careful that an OUCH still aligns the closing bracket (see second sample below).

#Upload text of source code, and 2 sample runs (one with, one without a border; the second one should include at least one OUCH)
